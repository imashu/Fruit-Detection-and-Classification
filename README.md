# Fruit-Detection-and-Classification
The system will be designed to be a cyber-physical system, where physical sensors will be connected to a microcontroller board such as Raspberry Pi, which will collect and process the data. The machine learning algorithms stored on disk  which will receive the data from the microcontroller board and predict the freshness of the fruits.

# Expected Deliverables

1. Application that can capture images of the fruits on the trees.
This application will detect fruits from the image captured and can tell whether the fruit is fresh
or rotten. It will act as an interface for a Farmer to check the Quality of Fruits on his farm.

2. R-pi module
- Raspberry Pi with a Pi camera with a motor to act as a Smart Fruit Separator.
3. Development of machine learning algorithms
- A model that detects fruits from images and classifies fruit as fresh or rotten.
