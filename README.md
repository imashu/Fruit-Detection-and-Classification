# Fruit-Detection-and-Classification
The system will be designed to be a cyber-physical system, where physical sensors will be connected to a microcontroller board such as Raspberry Pi, which will collect and process the data. The machine learning algorithms stored on disk  which will receive the data from the microcontroller board and predict the freshness of the fruits.
